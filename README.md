# TuringMachine
Assignment for CS2333

Ben, Evan

A Turing machine is an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.

The driver program is TuringGUI.java.

This program takes an input parameter of a text file, which it uses to load the Turing machine input, start state, accept state and transition function.
